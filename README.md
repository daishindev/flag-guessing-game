# flag-guessing-game
Its a work in progress, a simple thing i made in like an hour total,
Im planning on making it more complex.
The code is not clean at all as of now, I will make reusable functions etc. to clean it up.
For fetching the api I used Axios, i love it so much, its much better than vanilla JS fetching. Async await FTW!
